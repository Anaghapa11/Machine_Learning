# Machine Learning

# Assignment 1 - Statistical Measures 

# Steps done
1. Checked dataset info, missing values, and summary stats.
2. Used 4 methods:
Mean Â± 3*STD,Percentile (5%-95%),IQR,Z-Score.
3. Compared each method to visualize outlier removal.
4. Used histplot, skewness & kurtosis and Applied log transformation to reduce skewness.
5. Plotted heatmap of numerical features.
6. Visualized relationships (price, sqft, price/sqft).


# Assignment 2 - EDA and Preprocessing

# Steps done
1. Loaded the dataset and standardized column names.
2. Explored data: viewed structure, stats, and unique values.
3. Replaced invalid age values (0) with NaN.
4. Handled missing values using mean/median/mode.
5. Removed duplicates and identified outliers using IQR.
6. Filtered data (age > 40, salary < 5000) for analysis.
7. Visualized age vs. salary and people count by place.
8. Encoded categorical features (Label + One-Hot Encoding).
9. Scaled numeric features using StandardScaler and MinMaxScaler.
10. Saved cleaned and scaled datasets for ML use.
